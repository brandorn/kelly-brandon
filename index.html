  <p>Our ceremony and reception will take place at a secluded, light-filled venue on the shore of Lake Michigan in Highland Park.</p>

  <p>A few notes about the big day:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><b>Semi-formal attire:</b> We love an excuse to dress up, so this seems as good an occasion as any. When it comes to semi-formal attire, we’re basically saying, “Look sharp, but we’re not making you wear a tux.” Need help figuring out what to wear?</p>
      <div class="attire">
        <p><b>Women:</b> feel free to go a little fancier — wear anything from a long evening dress to a cocktail attire.</p>
        <p><b>Men:</b> A suit, long tie, and dress shoes will fit in perfectly.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>Parking:</b> There is parking on the premises, right next to the venue. What luck! <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2Di6LN9AWHWFFMmz6">Here it is on a map.</a></p></li>
    <li><p><b>Beach-friendly shoes:</b> Our ceremony will be held on the beach adjacent to the venue – please either wear shoes that can make it across the sand (wedges! block heels! flats!) or bring a spare pair of flip flops.</p></li>  
    <li><p><b>Open mic:</b> This small wedding celebration will be full of longtime friends and family — so we wanted to go a bit more <i>nontraditional</i> for toasts. Over dinner, anyone can take the mic to share a word of encouragement or a funny story. So, feel free to come ready to share!</p></li>

<section class=" playlist">
  <h2 id="playlist">3. &nbsp;Playlist</h2>
  <p>Our relationship began in the digital realm: emails, Facetime, texts, and — you guessed it — Spotify playlists. Since music (read: Sufjan) has been a marker of our love story, we thought it would be fun to share some of the songs that have provided the “soundtrack” to our relationship through the years. Give it a spin!</p>

<section class=" thanks">
  <h2 id="thanks">4. &nbsp;Thanks</h2>
  <p>We would be remiss to not mention all the people who have been so important to each of us throughout the years.</p>
  <p>Many thanks to Bob Davidson; as Brandon’s high school mentor and Kelly’s creative partner, you’ve played a pivotal role in both of our lives. Thank you for sending that fateful Sufjan email in March 2020; we (truly) would not be here without you.</p>
  <p>Thank you to our parents – Marcia and Dan, Kim and Mark – for being our biggest cheerleaders and our best role models. We love you!</p>
  <p>And many thanks to <b>all of you</b>, our friends and family, who have walked alongside us on our individual journeys and our lives together. We look forward to many years of growing and learning, with you by our side.</p>
