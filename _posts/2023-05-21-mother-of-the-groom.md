Of all the things I appreciate about my mom — her love of books, music, and art, our thoughtful conversations, her quiet, enduring faith — her steadfast support of me and Bryce over the years has meant the most. Beneath her gentle kindness is a foundation strong as stone, which has seen us through our whole lives. Maybe all moms have that kind of strength. Ours sure does.
