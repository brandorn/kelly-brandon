One of Brandon’s sweetest qualities is that he’s a nurturer. He effortlessly cares for things, whether Ani or the birds who visit his bird feeder or his many plants. One time I accompanied B on a trip to the local garden store and we ended up with this tree in the trunk. The tree is *thriving* under Brandon’s care, as if there’s any question.
