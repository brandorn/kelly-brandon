From waxing poetic about history, to helping me during my music shows, to answering all my questions about taxes and laws and math — my dad is my favorite person. He always said my wedding day would be the saddest day of his life (‘cuz he’s losing his little girl), but no one can or will ever replace him. Not even Brandon. (Sorry B).
