Bryce is the sweet, smart, silly brother I always wanted. Only-childhood was blissful those four years of my life, yet who would I be without him? I can't tell you how many times I've almost spit out my drink at dinner because of some goof he made that he knew only I'd get. Though we live far apart, I hold him dear.
