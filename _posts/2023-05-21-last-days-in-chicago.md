1529 S State was my last address in Chicago before moving to Durham and it will always be my most favorite place. It saw Lindsey (my roommate) and I through job transitions, broken hearts, and lots of trashy television shows (especially during COVID). This photo was taken on our last day, with our fave doorman, Tony. I like to think he was tearing up, but he was probably just tired.
