For Brandon, Bob Davidson is a life-long mentor: introducing him to the likes of Eugene Peterson and serving as a catalyst for reexamining and expanding his faith (and music repertoire). For me, Bob is equal parts life coach, creative partner, and cherished friend. I would not be the person I am today without Bob and we both owe him a lot â€” especially for graciously setting the stage for us to find each other.
