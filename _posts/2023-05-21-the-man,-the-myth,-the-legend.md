For Brandon, Bob Davidson is a life-long mentor: introducing him to the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_H._Peterson">Eugene Peterson</a> and serving as a catalyst for reexamining and expanding his faith (and music repertoire). For me, Bob is equal parts life coach, creative partner, and cherished friend. I would not be the person I am today without Bob and we both owe him a lot â€” especially for graciously setting the stage for us to find each other.
