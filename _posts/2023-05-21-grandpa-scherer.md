Kelly and he never met my Grandpa Ron, yet I know they would've been thick as thieves. My mom likes telling the story of how, when I was a toddler, I'd dance on top of the piano (!) when he'd play at The Sand Bar, his favorite restaurant where he lived in Florida. And how he once jumped into his pool, fully dressed for dinner, to rescue me when I walked right over the edge. I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for him, nor would I be the person I am.
