Among the many of Brandon’s qualities that I love, I particularly admire his capacity for serving and loving others. This note (accompanied by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Act-Way-Being/dp/0593652886">Rick Rubin’s recent book</a>) is a small but meaningful example to me of how this gentle kindness shows up; he gave it to me before my first show in Durham, knowing I was particularly uneasy going into it. I am continually amazed by and deeply appreciate his thoughtfulness and intentionality.
