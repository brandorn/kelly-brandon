My abuelita passed away a little over a year ago (at the tender age of 103) and perhaps the most bittersweet part of our wedding will be the realization that she’s not there to celebrate with us. She never got to meet Brandon, but I know she would have been delighted by his Spanish acumen and his kind heart. She most certainly would have also been impressed by his height — she was about 4'10" and he’s 6'2".
