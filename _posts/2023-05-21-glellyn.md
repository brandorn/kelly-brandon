Kelly and I have had different experiences of Glen Ellyn, the Chicago suburb where I grew up and where Kelly lived for a time after college. _She_ sees it as a beautiful example of small-town America preserving its history; _I_ see it as the town where I got in trouble with the police playing ghost-in-the-graveyard after dark. She (and my mom) hope we live there again someday. Time will tell!
