I met Kelly when I was preparing to emotionally hibernate and figure out my life as a 31-year-old divorcee. I had grieving to do, lots of it, and didn't know what that would look like. And I was getting ready to do it alone, or at least without a partner. And then, all of a sudden, I had someone to enter into it with. Kelly has seen me through the pain and confusion of grief's vicissitudes. Her presence and patience and love have helped me find clarity and peace. _Will wonders ever cease?_
