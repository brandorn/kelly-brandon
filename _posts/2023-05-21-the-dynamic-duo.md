It isn't often that we _want_ to hang out with our friends' kids. Don't get me wrong â€” kids are great. But usually we mostly want to see _our friends_. Yet Eloise and Olive are the exception. Sure, we love Curt (our pastor in Durham, who'll be officiating the wedding!) and his wife Jenny. But at this point we see them more as a means for getting to hang out with their precocious, hilarious, effervescent daughters.
