If you look at this photo closely, you'll see that Kelly isn't wearing _her_ engagement ring, but _her mom's!_ Marcia swapped when she "wanted to take a closer look" at it. It's clear where Kelly got her trickster tendencies from, yet, as this photo also shows, we love the Donaire silly side, and hope there's plenty more of that to come.
