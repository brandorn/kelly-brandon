My mom came to America by herself at the age of 13, learned English on the fly, put herself through college, danced disco like a pro, became a stellar dental hygienist, raised three kids, created a home for untold numbers of animals, and cared for my abuelita full time for 8+ years. Needless to say: Iâ€™ve learned a lot from my mom, and I am who I am today because of her.
