Kelly lived near Lake Michigan for 7 years before we met (11, if you count college). When she tells me about Chicago, which is often, Lake Michigan is always near to the conversation. Her walks along the Lakefront Trail and view of it from her South Loop apartment have shaped her sense of the city, and of herself. It was one of the reasons I proposed to her on its shore â€” and why we're getting married there, too.
