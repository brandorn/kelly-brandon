Fun fact: I _heard_ Kelly long before we first spoke. On one of his annual "Best of" playlists, Bob included a song of Kelly's from her i.e. kokoro days, which I really liked. What a treat it was to meet _the musician herself_ when he sent the fateful email to us both. Seeing her make and perform an album over the last few years has made me appreciate her talent all the more.
